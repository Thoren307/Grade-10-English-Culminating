Hello student from 1995. You're probbaly wondering if I'm really from the future. So I got something to prove it to you. Currently your principal is Robert G. Putman but come next semester you will have a new principal named Jean E. Goodier. For more proof that I am from the future, I will tell you the result of the upcoming referedum in Quebec.
